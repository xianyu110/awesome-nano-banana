### Case 100: Creative Ad with Real Object and Hand-Drawn Doodle (by [@azed_ai](https://x.com/azed_ai))

<sub>Image © 2025 <a href="https://github.com/jamez-bondos">@jamez-bondos</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> • Prompt by <a href="https://x.com/azed_ai">@azed_ai</a></sub>

**Prompt**

```
A minimalist and creative advertisement set on a clean white background.
A real [Real Object] is integrated into a hand-drawn black ink doodle, using loose, playful lines. The [Doodle Concept] interacts with the object in a clever, imaginative way. Include bold black [Ad Copy] text at the top or center. Place the [Brand Logo] clearly at the bottom. The visual should be clean, fun, high-contrast, and conceptually smart.
```

*Note: Replace [Real Object], [Doodle Concept], [Ad Copy], and [Brand Logo] in the prompt with specific details.
For example:
[Real Object]: coffee bean
[Doodle Concept]: The giant coffee bean becomes a space planet, with a small astronaut planting a flag on its surface
[Ad Copy]: "Explore Bold Flavor"
[Brand Logo]: Starbucks logo*

### Case 99: Black and White Portrait Art (by [@ZHO_ZHO_ZHO](https://x.com/ZHO_ZHO_ZHO))

<sub>Image © 2025 <a href="https://github.com/jamez-bondos">@jamez-bondos</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> • Prompt by <a href="https://x.com/ZHO_ZHO_ZHO">@ZHO_ZHO_ZHO</a></sub>

**Prompt**

```
A high-resolution black and white portrait artwork, in an editorial and fine art photography style. The background features a soft gradient, transitioning from mid-gray to almost pure white, creating a sense of depth and tranquility. Fine film grain adds a tactile, analog-like softness to the image, reminiscent of classic black and white photography.

On the right side of the frame, a blurred yet striking face of Harry Potter subtly emerges from the shadows, not in a traditional pose, but as if caught in a moment of thought or breath. Only a part of his face is visible: perhaps an eye, a cheekbone, the contour of his lips, evoking a sense of mystery, intimacy, and elegance. His features are delicate yet profound, exuding a melancholic and poetic beauty without being overly dramatic.

A gentle, directional light, softly diffused, caresses the curve of his cheek or glints in his eye—this is the emotional core of the image. The rest of the composition is dominated by ample negative space, intentionally kept simple, allowing the image to breathe. There are no texts, no logos in the image—only an interplay of light, shadow, and emotion.

The overall atmosphere is abstract yet deeply human, like a fleeting glance or a half-remembered dream: intimate, timeless, and poignantly beautiful.

<sub>Image © 2025 <a href="https://github.com/jamez-bondos">@jamez-bondos</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> • Prompt by <a href="https://x.com/umesh_ai">@umesh_ai</a></sub>

**Prompt**

```
A black and white photograph shows the blurred silhouette of a [SUBJECT] behind a frosted or translucent surface. The [PART] is sharply defined and pressed against the surface, creating a stark contrast with the rest of the hazy, indistinct figure. The background is a soft gradient of gray tones, enhancing the mysterious and artistic atmosphere.
```

*Note: Replace [SUBJECT] and [PART] with vivid, visually striking details that emphasize the “blurred subject + sharply defined part” contrast.
For example, set [SUBJECT] to “a Sith Lord wielding a red lightsaber in one hand” and [PART] to “the other hand channeling the dark side of the Force.”*

**Prompt**

```
Hyperrealistic, top-down bird's-eye view shot, a beautiful Instagram model [Anne Hathaway / see reference image], with exquisite and beautiful makeup and fashionable styling, standing on the screen of a smartphone held up by someone. The image creates a strong perspective illusion. Emphasize the 3D effect of the girl standing out from the phone. She wears black-rimmed glasses, high-street fashion, and strikes a cute, playful pose. The phone screen is treated as a dark floor, like a small stage. The scene uses strong forced perspective to show the proportional difference between the hand, the phone, and the girl. The background is clean gray, using soft indoor light, shallow depth of field, and the overall style is surrealistic photorealistic compositing. Very strong perspective.
```

*Note: You can replace [Anne Hathaway] in the prompt with other character names. Or use a photo of a person as a reference image.*

**Reference Image Required:** You can use a photo of a person as a reference image. This example image uses ["Girl with a Pearl Earring"](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=55017931) as a reference image.

Indiscriminate flaps and folds and scratches all around simply from moving back and forth causing subtle yet incremental damage with the ever expanding of entropy we cannot escape, but the loving memories in our hearts will forever be whole.

**Prompt**

```
{
    "prompt": "A futuristic trading card with a dark, moody neon aesthetic and soft sci-fi lighting. The card features a semi-transparent, rounded rectangle with slightly muted glowing edges, appearing as if made of holographic glass. At the center is a large glowing logo of {{logo}}, with no additional text or label, illuminated with a smooth gradient of {{colors}}, but not overly bright. The reflections on the card surface should be subtle, with a slight glossy finish catching ambient light. The background is a dark carbon fiber texture or deep gradient with soft ambient glows bleeding into the edges. Add subtle light rays streaming down diagonally from the top, giving the scene a soft cinematic glow. Apply light motion blur to the edges and reflections to give the scene a sense of depth and energy, as if it's part of a high-end tech animation still. Below the card, include realistic floor reflections that mirror the neon edges and logo—slightly diffused for a grounded, futuristic look. Text elements are minimal and softly lit: top-left shows '{{ticker}}', top-right has a stylized signature, and the bottom displays '{{company_name}}' with a serial number '{{card_number}}', a revenue badge reading '{{revenue}}', and the year '{{year}}'. Typography should have a faint glow with slight blurring, and all elements should feel premium, elegant, and softly illuminated—like a high-end cyberpunk collectible card.",
    "style": {
        "lighting": "Neon glow, soft reflections",
        "font": "Modern sans-serif, clean and minimal",
        "layout": "Centered, structured like a digital collectible card",
        "materials": "Glass, holographic plastic, glowing metal edges"
    },
    "parameters": {
        "logo": "Tesla logo",
        "ticker": "TSLA",
        "company_name": "Tesla Inc.",
        "card_number": "#0006",
        "revenue": "$96.8B",
        "year": "2025",

    },
    "medium": "3D render, high-resolution digital art",
    "size": "1080px by 1080px"
}
```

*Note: The prompt uses a JSON-like structure to describe card elements. Modify values in the `parameters` object (like logo, ticker, company_name, colors, etc.) to customize the card. For custom logos, specify in `parameters.logo` (e.g., "Framer logo (attached image)") and upload the image.*

**Prompt**

```
Ultra-realistic 3D rendered image that replicates the character design of Natasha from Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 in 2008, following the original model exactly. The scene is set in a dim and cluttered bedroom from the year 2008. The character is sitting on the carpet, facing an old-fashioned television that is playing Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 and a game console controller.
The entire room is filled with a nostalgic atmosphere of the year 2008: snack packaging bags, soda cans, posters, and tangled wires are everywhere. Natasha Volkova is captured in the moment of turning her head, looking back at the camera over her shoulder. There is an innocent smile on her iconic ethereally beautiful face. Her upper body is slightly twisted, with a natural dynamic, as if she is reacting to being startled by the flash.
The flash slightly overexposes her face and clothes, making her silhouette stand out more prominently in the dimly lit room. The whole photo appears raw and natural. The strong contrast between light and dark casts deep shadows behind her. The image is full of tactile feel, with a simulated texture that resembles an authentic film snapshot from 2008.

**Prompt**

```
A steampunk-style mechanical fish with a brass body and clearly visible gear mechanisms when in motion.
Its mechanical teeth can be slightly seen, neatly arranged and closed, with both upper and lower teeth visible. Each tooth is triangular in shape and made of diamond material.
The tail fin has a metal wire mesh structure, while other fins are made of semi-transparent amber-colored glass with some subtle bubbles inside.
The eyes are multi-faceted rubies, with clearly visible reflective shine.
The fish has "f-is-h" text clearly visible on its body, with all lowercase letters and careful attention to the hyphen placement.
The image is square, showing the entire fish in the center of the frame, with its head pointing to the right. There is adequate white space around the fish, with more space on the left and right sides. The background has subtle steampunk-style gear patterns.
The entire fish looks very cool. This is a high-definition image with extremely rich details and unique texture and aesthetics. The image should not be too dark.
```

*Note: This image showcases an excellent combination of steampunk style and metallic textures, presenting intricate mechanical details and a retro-futuristic aesthetic.*

**Prompt**

```
Please draw an extremely ordinary and unremarkable iPhone selfie, with no clear subject or sense of composition — just like a random snapshot taken casually. The photo should include slight motion blur, with uneven lighting caused by sunlight or indoor lights resulting in mild overexposure. The angle is awkward, the composition is messy, and the overall aesthetic is deliberately plain — as if it was accidentally taken while pulling the phone out of a pocket.
The subjects are Eason Chan and Nicholas Tse, taken at night, next to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, by Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong.
```

*Note: This prompt aims to generate a photo that looks very casual, even slightly like an accidental snapshot.*

Place it on a clean, minimal background (light gray or pale blue), and maintain a playful, sculptural aesthetic.

```
An ultra-photorealistic, cinematic-style illustration depicting Lara Croft dynamically bursting through the frame of an “Archaeological Adventure” trading card. She is caught mid-jump or swinging on a rope, wearing her iconic adventurer outfit and possibly firing dual pistols. The muzzle flashes help shatter the card’s ancient stone-carved border, creating a visible dimensional rupture with energy cracks and spatial distortions, scattering dust and debris outward.

Her body lunges forward with powerful momentum, breaking through the card’s flat plane, emphasizing strong motion depth. Inside the card (the background) is a depiction of dense jungle ruins or a trap-filled ancient tomb. The shattered card fragments mix with crumbling stone, flying vines, broken ancient coins, and spent shell casings.

The title “Archaeological Adventure” and the name “Lara Croft” (accompanied by a stylized artifact icon) remain visible on the remaining cracked and weathered parts of the card. The scene is lit with adventurous, dynamic lighting that emphasizes her agility and the perilous environment.
```

*Note: The original tweet mentioned key terms are "dimensional break effects" and "motion depth". The prompt above is a reconstruction based on the description.*

**Prompt**

```
A hyper-realistic isometric 3D render of a miniature computer setup inside a translucent mechanical keyboard keycap, specifically placed on the ESC key of a real matte-finished mechanical keyboard. Inside the keycap, a tiny figure sits in a modern ergonomic chair, wearing a cozy textured hoodie, working at a glowing ultra-realistic computer screen. The environment is packed with lifelike miniature tech accessories: real-material desk lamps, monitors with reflections, tiny speaker grills, tangled cables, and ceramic mugs. The base of the scene is made of soil, rocks, and moss, with photorealistic textures and imperfections. The lighting inside the cap mimics natural morning sun, casting soft shadows and warm tones, while the outside has cold ambient reflections from the surrounding keyboard. The word “ESC” is subtly etched onto the top of the translucent keycap with a faint frosted glass effect — just barely visible depending on the angle. The surrounding keyboard keys like F1, Q, Shift, and CTRL are crisp, textured, and photorealistically lit. Shot as if taken with a high-end mobile phone camera, with shallow depth of field, perfect white balance, and cinematic detail.

**Prompt**

```
Create a two-panel vertical manga in a cute Japanese anime style, theme: “The Daily Work Life of a Girl President.”

Character Design:
Transform the person in the uploaded image into a cute, moe-style anime girl while preserving all key details from the photo — including the outfit (a suit), hairstyle (bright golden-yellow), and facial features.

Panel 1:
- Expression: Pouting, disappointed, resting her cheek on one hand
- Text box: “What do I dooo?! He won’t take my call! (；´д｀)”
- Scene: Warm-toned office, with the U.S. flag in the background. On the desk: a pile of hamburgers and a vintage red rotary phone. The character is on the left side of the frame, the phone on the right.

Panel 2:
- Expression: Furious, face red with anger, gritting teeth
- Action: Slams the desk hard, making the hamburgers jump
- Speech bubble: “Hmph! Double the tariffs! Ignoring me is their loss! ( `д´ )”
- Scene: Same office, now a complete mess

Additional Notes:
- Use a cute, casual handwritten font for all text
- Keep the composition full and expressive, with adequate space for dialogue and intentional white space
- Aspect ratio: 2:3
- The overall visual tone should be colorful and energetic, with a distinctly cartoony style
```

**Prompt**

```
Create a hand-drawn style infographic card in a 9:16 vertical format. The card should have a clear theme, with a beige or off-white paper-textured background. The overall design should reflect a simple, warm, and handmade aesthetic.

At the top of the card, use large, eye-catching brush-style Chinese cursive calligraphy in red and black for the title, creating strong visual contrast. All text should be in Chinese cursive script. The layout should be divided into 2 to 4 clear sections, each conveying a core idea through concise and refined Chinese phrases. The calligraphy should maintain a fluid, rhythmic style that is both legible and artistically expressive. Leave appropriate blank space around the text.

The card should be accented with simple and fun hand-drawn illustrations or icons — such as figures or symbolic elements — to enhance visual appeal and spark thought or emotional resonance. The overall layout should emphasize visual balance and include ample whitespace, ensuring the design is clean, clear, and easy to read.

**Prompt**

```
“Master Oats”: Based on the visual features of the person in the uploaded photo, generate a custom oatmeal mix that reflects their personality traits — for example, using vegetables, fruits, yogurt, whole grains, etc.

Design a unique cereal box and package aesthetic that aligns with this tailored mix.

Then, create an advertising cover featuring the person as the mascot on the cereal box. The character should retain their recognizable features but be transformed into a cute chibi-style 3D figure with a C4D-quality rendering.

The oatmeal and packaging should be presented in a setting that matches the mood — such as a minimalist kitchen, a sleek supermarket display, or a clean design counter.

The process includes:
– Character analysis and oat mix pairing
– Cereal box concept and design
– Display environment selection
– Final image with mascot figure, packaging, and styled scene composition

All visuals should be balanced, modern, and appealing, reflecting a premium and fun oat brand identity.

Create a finely crafted, adorably charming 3D-rendered collectible figure based on the subjects in the photo, displayed inside a pastel-toned, warm and romantic presentation box. The box is designed in a soft cream color with gentle gold accents, resembling an elegant portable jewelry case.

When opened, the box reveals a heartwarming romantic scene: two chibi-style characters gazing sweetly at each other. The lid is engraved with the words “FOREVER TOGETHER,” surrounded by delicate star and heart motifs.

Inside the box stands the female from the photo, holding a small bouquet of white flowers. Beside her is her partner, the male from the photo. Both characters have large, expressive, sparkling eyes and soft, warm smiles that radiate affection and charm.

Behind them is a round window, through which a sunny skyline of a traditional Chinese town can be seen, along with gently drifting clouds. The interior is softly lit with warm ambient lighting, and petals float in the background to enhance the atmosphere.

The overall color scheme of both the display box and the characters is elegant and harmonious, creating a luxurious and dreamlike miniature keepsake.

**Prompt**

```
An illustration in satirical comic style, rendered in a vintage American comic aesthetic. The background features a multi-tiered shelf stocked entirely with identical red baseball caps. The caps have a bold slogan on the front: “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,” while a white side tag on each reads “MADE IN CHINA.” The composition uses a close-up perspective focusing on one specific red cap.
At the bottom of the image, a price label is shown: the original price “$50.00” is crossed out with a thick black X and replaced with “$77.00.” The overall color palette uses nostalgic ochre and deep red tones, with shading that mimics the textured print style of 1990s retro comics.
The composition is exaggerated and satirical, carrying a strong critique of political consumerism.

**Prompt**

```
A vertical (3:4) 4K-resolution minimalist futurist exhibition poster with an ultra-light cool gray background (#f4f4f4).

At the center of the poster is a fluid 3D metaball shaped like a classic Coca-Cola bottle in full form, rendered in frosted glass with delicate grainy noise.
The fluid gradient transitions from Coca-Cola Red (#E41C23) to Pearl White (#FFFFFF), giving it a silky glass-like appearance.

High-position softbox lighting casts long, soft colored shadows and a subtle halo.

The fluid overlaps with the text: letters obscured by the frosted glass appear with a gentle Gaussian blur.
•The main title, the classic red “Coca-Cola” logo, is centered and partially obscured by the fluid. The covered letters are slightly blurred through the frosted glass.
•The subtitle, in bold all-caps modern sans-serif pure black font, reads: “TASTE THE FEELING”, placed below the main title. It is also partially overlapped by the fluid and blurred in those areas, while the rest remains sharp.

The overall layout is clean with generous whitespace, balanced composition, sharp focus, and HDR high dynamic range.
```

*Note: The [Classic 3D Coca-Cola Bottle] in the prompt can be replaced with descriptions of other items to generate posters with different themes.*

**Prompt**

```
Generate a vertically-oriented image based on my uploaded photo, using the following prompt:
Classic LEGO minifigure style in a miniature scene — an animal stands beside me. The color palette of the animal should match mine.
Please design the animal based on your understanding of me. You may choose any creature — real, surreal, or fantastical — that you feel best reflects my personality.
The entire scene is set within a transparent glass cube, with a minimalist interior design.
The base of the miniature is matte black with silver accents, following a clean and modern aesthetic.
On the base, there is an elegantly engraved nameplate in a refined serif font, displaying the name of the animal.
The lower part of the base subtly incorporates finely etched biological classification details, similar to a natural history museum display.
The overall composition should resemble a high-end collectible artwork: meticulously crafted, curated in style, and lit with refined lighting.
Balance is key to the layout. The background should feature a smooth gradient transition from dark to light tones, selected to match the dominant color theme.
```

### Case 6: Character Stepping Through Portal (by [@dotey](https://x.com/dotey))

<sub>Image © 2025 <a href="https://github.com/jamez-bondos">@jamez-bondos</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> • Prompt by <a href="https://x.com/dotey">@dotey</a></sub>

**Prompt**

```
A 3D chibi-style version of the person in the photo is stepping through a glowing portal, reaching out and holding the viewer’s hand. As the character pulls the viewer forward, they turn back with a dynamic glance, inviting the viewer into their world.
Behind the portal is the viewer’s real-life environment: a typical programmer’s study with a desk, monitor, and laptop, rendered in realistic detail. Inside the portal lies the character’s 3D chibi world, inspired by the photo, with a cool blue color scheme that sharply contrasts with the real-world surroundings.
The portal itself is a perfectly elliptical frame glowing with mysterious blue and purple light, positioned at the center of the image as a gateway between the two worlds.
The scene is captured from a third-person perspective, clearly showing the viewer’s hand being pulled into the character’s world. Use a 2:3 aspect ratio.

**Prompt**

```
Transform the two people in the photo into chibi-style 3D cartoon characters, dressed in traditional Chinese wedding attire. The overall theme is a festive red Chinese-style wedding. The background features a decorative “囍” (double happiness) paper-cut pattern in a classic folk style. 
Clothing (realistic texture, traditional details):
Male: Wearing a red changpao and magua (traditional robe and jacket) embroidered with golden dragon motifs, symbolizing nobility and grandeur. A large red flower is tied on his chest, representing celebration and good fortune.
Female: Dressed in a red xiuhe wedding gown adorned with exquisite golden floral and phoenix embroidery, showcasing elegance and luxury. She wears delicate floral hair ornaments to enhance her gentle and graceful appearance.
Headwear:
Male: A traditional red zhuangyuan (scholar) hat with golden patterns and a refined golden ornament at the top, exuding classic scholarly dignity.
Female: A phoenix crown adorned with a central red flower, gold 3D decorative elements, and hanging tassels—luxurious and full of classical charm.
This image should reflect the joy and blessing of a traditional Chinese wedding, with realistic textures for costumes and accessories, combined with stylized 3D chibi characters.
